<p>In the application that I work on, remote users upload files to a website and then view them. I wanted to see how much of that same use-case could be possible done locally.</p>
<label for="fileUpload">Read a file:</label>
<input type="file" [formControl]="fileForm"
       id="fileUpload"
       accept="text/*"
       (change)="changeListener($event)" #input>
